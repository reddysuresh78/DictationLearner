# DictationLearner

This is a capstone project for Udacity Android Nanodegree. 

The goal of this application is to make children practice/learn and test the english dictation words. 

Parent will create a list of words in a dictation and optionally set an image for each word so that kids could relate the word to picture. 

Kids will be able to practice and test it. 

Parent then will be able to see the test history and focus on the words that kid requires help with.
